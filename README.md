# Garden Shift Manager

### About 
A one stop shop for managing your garden members and their membership duties! This project was borne out of a fantasy that I could get my community garden to house information (such as contact details, events, and shift logging) in one place. It is also a vehicle for me to learn Ruby on Rails. That latter part will at least come true! 

Some of the basic functionality I aim to have is the following:

- House a list of all garden members with their contact information, available to all other members
- Display all open hour shifts for the season in a calendar view (with options to see day/week/month versions of this view)
- Allow members to sign up/un-sign up for said shifts
- Admin members (i.e. the Steering Committee) to monitor members are fulfilling their membership duties (attending at least x open hour shifts)

Why learn Ruby on Rails? I want to learn a new language. I only really know Javascript and its libraries and I have gotten very comfortable with those tools. 

I will also be documenting my progress with this project and the blog page will be up shortly!
